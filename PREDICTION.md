# Predicting Receptor Responses to Ligands

At this time, no method yet exists to accurately distinguish agonist from non-agonist ligands using PrimaryDock output.
To the best of our knowledge, either no one has developed the capability to make such predictions, or no accurate
prediction making utility has been released to the public. Therefore, we continue to strive towards accurate predictions
of GPCR agonism by odorants.


# Prediction Methods

PrimaryDock prediction methods are cronnable PHP scripts that perform docks of known ligands in PDB files and aggregate
the resulting data into a JSON file. A prediction method begins with `require("methods_common.php");`, followed by a
call to `prepare_outputs();` which generates the output file names as well as some other custom variables. A string
value named `$configf` is then set, containing the config file to be generated for the `primarydock` app, and then the
`process_dock()` function is called.

The most current prediction method is `method_optimized.php`. The first time it is run, it will perform a one-time
setup of required data, including an automatic download of PDB models from the RCSB and AlphaFold websites. An example
of the command line for running a prediction might be:

```
php -f predict/method_optimized.php prot=OR1A1 lig=cis-3-hexen-1-ol
```

If the name of the ligand contains parentheses, it's a good idea to put the entire lig= parameter in quotes, e.g.:

```
php -f predict/method_optimized.php prot=OR1A1 "lig=(S)-(+)-carvone"
```

The prediction method lends itself well to running as a cron, e.g.:

```
* * * * * php -f /path/to/primarydock/predict/method_coupled.php next simul=8
```

In this example, the `next` parameter means to find the next GPCR/G-protein pair or GPCR/ligand pair yet to process,
and process it. The "next" pair to process is the first pair of GPCR + known ligand (whether agonist or not) that
either is not present in `predict/dock_results_optimized.json` or has a `version` value older than either the
prediction method .php, `methods_common.php`, or the `/bin/primarydock` executable.

The `simul=8` parameter indicates not to run more than 8 concurrent processes. We recommend a value of no more than
the number of physical cores on your machine, so if you have a server with one 8-core processor, then `simul=8` would
be the maximum recommended value. If you have `lm-sensors` installed (`sudo apt-get install lm-sensors`), then both PHP
scripts will automatically limit themselves depending on the CPU temperature.

You can use the `predict/progress.sh` shell script to monitor the progress of both PHP scripts.


# Writing Your Own Prediction Methods

Until an accurate prediction method exists, we encourage you to write your own prediction methods. You can use the
`method_basic.php` script as a template, and then apply any variations you wish. If you create a method that makes
predictions with at least 80% accuracy, we'd be delighted to accept your pull request.

Configurable variables include:
`$dock_metals`          If true, the dock will use PDBs that end in `.metal.pdb` instead of the default `.upright.pdb`.
                        You probably won't ever have to use the `$dock_metals` feature.
`$dock_retries`         The number of times to retry if no poses returned. Each retry increases the energy limit.
                        Default = 5.
`$bias_by_energy`       TODO: This has not been implemented yet.
`$metrics_to_process`   An array of key-value pairs identifying a dock metric and its new key in the output JSON.
                        Valid keys can be found in the table below; the value becomes the metric's key in the JSON.

Available parameters for `$metrics_to_process` include:
`BENERG`                Total binding energy between ligand and protein;
`BENERG.rgn`            Total binding energy between ligand and specific regions of the protein, e.g. TMR6;
`vdWRPL`                Total van der Waals repulsion (i.e. where atoms are < 4Ã… apart) ligand to protein;
`vdWRPL.rgn`            Total vdW repulsion between ligand and regions of protein;
`POLSAT`                Ligand's sum polar satisfaction, a measure of polar-polar and nonpolar-nonpolar proximity;
`PCLASH`                Clashes between residues of the protein, minus clashes in the original PDB model;

`ACVTH.TMR1` thru `ACVTH.TMR7`
                        Angles of helix rotations performed for a "soft dock", in which the helices are allowed to move.

`POSES`                 Total number of poses found.
`CALOC.rgn`             Average relative motion of alpha carbon atoms within each region as a result of a "soft dock".

For keys ending with `.rgn`, the `rgn` will be replaced with the actual region name. For example, if the method PHP
specifies `BENERG.rgn` => `energy.rgn`, then the JSON will contain metrics labeled `energy.TMR3`, `energy.TMR6`, etc.
