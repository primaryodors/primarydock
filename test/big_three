# If the `play chime.mp3` command causes an error after the OR1A1 and TAAR8 tests, you can fix it by omitting the play command or by
# installing sox, for example using the following on Debian-based systems:
#
# sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all
#

# The amino aldehyde test is part of make code. Otherwise the test would be: test/molecule_test "NCCCC=O" "NCCCC=O" 10
# Optionally: use the viewer to ensure that the two aldehyde groups are coordinated to the two amino groups.
clear; make code

# TAAR8 test: Check the per-residue output and ensure that ASP111 and ASP201 both have strong binding values between -40 and -75.
# Optionally, use the viewer to ensure that the two amino groups of the ligand are coordinated to the aforementioned ASP residues.
clear; bin/primarydock test/testTAAR8.config && play chime.mp3

# Limonene test: Check for at least one successful binding pose with a total energy of less than zero.
# *If using the ZhangLab PDB*, do a visual check using the viewer that Asp111 is not pulled awway from its salt bridge configuration with His243.
