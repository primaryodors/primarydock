# The PrimaryOdors.org admin predicts this ligand to be an agonist of this
# receptor based on the following description of the receptor's sensitivity:
#
# "Our results indicate that the presence of an aldehyde group connected to
# an aromatic ring via a carbon chain of defined length (3â€“5 carbons), and
# containing a methyl group at the a or b position, are key determinants
# for an active hOR17-40 ligand. The addition of functional groups at the
# para position of the aromatic ring is not essential but slightly increases
# the ability of the ligand to activate the receptor."

# Floralozone has an aldehyde group connected to an aromatic ring by a 3-
# carbon chain, with two methyl groups at the alpha position.
# It also has an ethyl group at the para position.
# Floralozone also smells "green", having a green-vegetable note that it
# shares with other OR3A1 agonists such as helional, trifernal, and cyclamal.
# This "green" note of floralozone can be observed to disappear when mixed
# with bourgeonal, an OR3A1 antagonist.
