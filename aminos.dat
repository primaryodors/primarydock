# Defines the bonds and charges of amino acid atoms.
#
# The columns are: AA letter, AA 3-letter, AA name, atom name, bonded-to name(s), cardinality/ies, atom charge, and amino acid SMILES.
# Note the precise alignment of the columns is not critical, as the software parses each line as columns separated by one or more spaces.
#
# If you add a new entry to this file, make sure to also add the 1-letter and 3-letter codes to the constants in the top of viewer.htm.
