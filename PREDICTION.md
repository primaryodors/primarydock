# Predicting Receptor Responses to Ligands

At this time, no method yet exists to accurately identify agonist and non-agonist ligands from PrimaryDock output.
To the best of our knowledge, either no one has developed this capability, or they have not released it to the public.
Nevertheless, we continue to strive towards accurate predictions of GPCR agonism by odorants.

# Prediction Methods

PrimaryDock prediction methods are cronnable PHP scripts that perform docks of known ligands in PDB files and aggregate
the resulting data into a JSON file. A prediction method begins with `require("methods_common.php");`, followed by a
call to `prepare_outputs();` which generates the output file names as well as some other custom variables. A string
value named `$configf` is then set, containing the config file to be generated for the `primarydock` app, and then the
`process_dock()` function is called.

The most current prediction method is `method_coupled.php`. To use this prediction method, one must first generate PDBs
of all the olfactory GPCRs coupled to G proteins. This is handled by another cronnable PHP script named
`generate_couple.php`. Here's an example crontab:

```
* * * * * php -f /path/to/primarydock/predict/generate_couple.php next
* * * * * php -f /path/to/primarydock/predict/method_coupled.php next simul=4
```

The prediction method will not begin processing until no more instances of `generate_couple.php` are running. For both
scripts, the `next` parameter means find the next GPCR/G-protein pair or GPCR/ligand pair yet to process, and process
it. For `generate_couple.php`, the next pair to process is the first combination of GPCR/G-protein that does not yet
have a PDB file in the `pdbs/coupled/` folder. For `method_coupled.php`, the next pair to process is the first pair of
GPCR + known ligand (whether agonist or not) that either is not present in `predict/dock_results_coupled.json` or has
a `version` value older than either the prediction method PHP, `methods_common.php`, or the `/bin/primarydock`
executable.

The `simul=4` parameter indicates not to run more than 4 concurrent processes. We recommend a value of half the number
of cores on your machine, so if you have a server with one 8-core processor, then `simul=4` would be the recommended
value, whereas if you are running it on a 4-core machine, then we recommend `simul=2` instead.

You can use the `predict/progress.sh` shell script to monitor the cron's progress.

# Writing Your Own Prediction Methods

Until an accurate prediction method exists, we encourage you to write your own prediction methods. You can use the
`method_basic.php` script as a template, and then apply any variations you wish. If you create a method that makes
predictions with at least 80% accuracy, we'd be delighted to accept your pull request.

Configurable variables include:
`$dock_metals`          If true, the dock will use PDBs that end in `.metal.pdb` instead of the default `.upright.pdb`.
`$dock_retries`         The number of times to retry if no poses returned. Each retry increases the energy limit.
`$bias_by_energy`       TODO: This has not been implemented yet.
`$metrics_to_process`   An array of key-value pairs identifying a dock metric and its new key in the output JSON.

Available parameters for `$metrics_to_process` include:
`BENERG`                Total binding energy between ligand and protein;
`BENERG.rgn`            Total binding energy between ligand and specific regions of the protein, e.g. TMR6;
`vdWRPL`                Total van der Waals repulsion (i.e. where atoms are < 4Ã… apart) ligand to protein;
`vdWRPL.rgn`            Total vdW repulsion between ligand and regions of protein;
`POLSAT`                Ligand's sum polar satisfaction, a measure of polar-polar and nonpolar-nonpolar proximity;
`PCLASH`                Clashes between residues of the protein, minus clashes in the original PDB model;

`ACVTH.TMR1` thru `ACVTH.TMR7`
                        Angles of helix rotations performed for a "soft dock", in which the helices are allowed to move.

`POSES`                 Total number of poses found.
`CALOC.rgn`             Average relative motion of alpha carbon atoms within each region as a result of a "soft dock".
