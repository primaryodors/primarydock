# The amino aldehyde test is part of make code. Otherwise the test would be: test/molecule_test "NCCCC=O" "NCCCC=O" 10
# Optionally: use the viewer to ensure that the two aldehyde groups are coordinated to the two amino groups.

# TAAR8 test: Check the per-residue output and ensure that ASP111 and ASP201 both have strong binding values between -40 and -75.
# Optionally, use the viewer to ensure that the two amino groups of the ligand are coordinated to the aforementioned ASP residues.
