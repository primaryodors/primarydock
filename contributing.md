Contributing to this project:

- I am sooo very grateful for the help!
- Please make sure your branch is based off `stable`;
- Each PR should add or change one feature only, or at most, a few closely related features;
- All PRs that change the C++ classes or the primarydock app *must* pass the Big Three test (see the test/big_three file), and receive a three green squares message, before merge.
- Use whichever { style you prefer; as long as the code is readable and it works, that's all that should matter anyway.
- Have fun and try not to let the project vex you. (:
