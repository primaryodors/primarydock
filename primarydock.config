#
# Modify this or create fresh.
# Note that every parameter listed in this file can also be given as a command line
# argument, e.g.:
#
# bin/primarydock --lig sdf/helional.sdf --diff test/1a1_citral.config --out output/OR1A1_helional.test.dock # Dock helional using the same settings as for citral.
#
# Note that if you override the PROT parameter, it is also recommended you override
# CEN, PATH, STATE, and EXCL (as applicable) since these will vary slightly from
# protein to protein.
#

# Path to PDB of protein (required):
PROT pdbs/OR1/OR1A1.upright.pdb

# Optional: Add hydrogens to the protein after loading it.
# Strongly recommended if the PDB does not contain hydrogen atoms.
# HYDRO

# Path to PDB or SDF of ligand (required):
LIG sdf/citral.sdf

# Center of binding pocket (required):
# Can be ABS or RES; default is ABS if unspecified.
# ABS means use literal XYZ coordinates.
# RES means average the CA locations of all indicated
#     residue numbers or Ballesteros-Weinstein numbers.
# CEN ABS -4.93883 5.08067 -4.91533

CEN RES 2.53 3.29 3.32 3.33 3.36 3.37 3.40 3.41 4.53 4.57 4.60 45.49 45.52 5.39 5.43 5.46 5.47 6.48 6.51 7.38 7.39 7.42

# Optional required contact residues. These are residues that the ligand must bind
# to if possible. During dock, the ligand may not pull away from any of these residues
# if the binding energy between the ligand and residue is smaller than 5 kJ/mol.
# These can be thought of more as "sticky" residues rather than mandatory interactions,
# since the behavior is to move closer to each residue until the threshold coordination
# energy is met.
# Each REQSR is tied to a node number, in this case node zero. There is no limit to the
# number of REQSR parameters. If applying a REQSR to all path nodes, it is best to use
# the word ALL in place of a node number, so that the binding energies won't be reset
# between nodes.
# REQSR 0 4.57 4.60 5.39

# Optional path. If given, PrimaryDock will attempt to move the ligand along the
# path and report the binding energy at each node.
# The pocket center is considered to be node zero.
# Nodes must be numbered from 1 to n, where n < 256.
# Path can be ABS, REL, or RES. ABS and RES work the same as CEN above, while
# REL takes relative XYZ coordinates to add to the previous node's coordinates.
# Default is ABS if unspecified - NOTE this is different from the previous behavior
# where REL was the only option, so please update your config files!
# RES is particularly valuable when using STATE params, as detailed below.
# PATH 1 REL -2.0 -2.5 -0.5
# PATH 2 RES 112 206 251
# PATH 3 RES 115 213 244
# PATH 4 RES 59 118 240

# Optional active configuration
# If at least one PATH is specified, and an active node is specified, then during
# docking, when the calculation reaches the indicated path node, the protein will
# be modified by having indicated parts moved and rotated in space. The below lines,
# if uncommented, will affect the region of BW# 6.26 - 6.60, corresponding to
# transmembrane helix 6, as follows: it will be rotated about the 6.48 residue,
# about an axis defined by relative coordinates [-0.55 0 0.84], 20 degrees in the
# positive (clockwise) direction, with no spatial transform (i.e. relative coordinates
# [0 0 0] to be added to all residues in range).
# This corresponds to the active state of an OR per BillesbÃ¸lle et al (2022).
# https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.20.520951
# The active node can have an unlimited number of ACVHXR params.
# ACVNODE 2
# ACVHXR TMR6 6.26 6.60 6.48 0 0 0 -0.55 0 0.84 20

# Optional per-node conformation
# Similar to ACVHXR above, it is possible to define an unlimited number of rotations
# and/or transformations to be applied at specific nodes, without having to limit
# them to a single active state node.
# The below lines, if uncommented, will immediately move TMR6 2A in the +Y direction,
# then rotate it 5 degrees for each subsequent node.
# Note all rotations and transformations are *cumulative*, not absolute; if given two
# consecutive HXR lines each with a 5 degree rotation, the final rotation will be 10
# degrees relative to the original protein structure.
# The format is HXR node region start_resno end_resno pivot_resno transform_xyz axis theta.
# Possible values for the axis include Cartesian (three floating point numbers separated by
# spaces), region region_name, bw bw.number, or atom bw.number:aname.
# HXR 0 TMR6 6.26 6.60 6.48 0 2 0 -0.55 0 0.84 0
# HXR 1 TMR6 6.26 6.60 6.48 0 0 0 region TMR2 5
# HXR 2 TMR6 6.26 6.60 6.48 0 0 0 bw 2.50 5
# HXR 3 TMR6 6.26 6.60 6.48 0 0 0 atom 2.50:CA 5

# Optional protein conformational states.
# If the protein changes shape during path docking, you can indicate which parts of
# the protein move by how much at which path node. An imaginary axis of rotation is
# drawn from the starting residue's CA to the ending residue's CA, then a rotation
# of the indicated number of degrees is performed. The below line, if uncommented,
# would indicate a 25 degree (counterclockwise if viewed from residue 210 looking at
# residue 248) rotation of the line from 210:CA to 240:CA at path node 4. For OR1A1
# this corresponds to bending the TMR5 and TMR6 helices outwards into approximately
# the typical GPCR active configuration.
# Each path node can have an unlimited number of STATE params.
# STATE 3 210 248 25

# Optional alternate PDB, e.g. for receptor activation.
# If uncommented, the specified path node number (in this example 4) will trigger
# loading an alternate model of the protein for docking. This makes it possible to
# dock the ligand first in the protein's default conformational state, and then in
# an alternate conformational state while preserving the conformation of the ligand.
# NODEPDB 4 pdbs/OR1/OR1A1.active.pdb

# Pocket size. If one number is given, it forms the radius of a sphere
# centered around the pocket center. If three numbers are given, they form
# the XYZ radii of an aspect-ratio-distorted spheroid centered around
# the pocket center.
# Default: 10.0.
SIZE 6.0 7.5 5.5

# Optional exclusion zones. Useful for e.g. extracellular loops that in the real world
# protein would flex wildly and not constitute part of the binding pocket.
EXCL 1 57		# Head, TMR1, and CYT1.
EXCL 164 195	# EXR2 between TMR4 and TMR5.

# Optional "soft pocket" zones. Defines regions of the protein that are allowed to
# move around during docking, to accommodate ligands of different sizes.
# All regions used here must be defined in the PDB file with REMARK 650 HELIX records.
# SOFT TMR2 TMR4 TMR5 TMR6 TMR7

# Maximum number of poses to output. Default 10.
POSE 10

# Search method.
# Valid choices are BB (best binding) or TS (tumble spheres).
# Best binding looks for the three pairs of ligand-side chain atoms with the best chance
# of forming a non-covalent bond, and attempts to align the ligand accordingly.
# Tumble spheres calculates the imaginary spheres the side chains can flex to inhabit,
# and free-form tumbles the ligand inside this space looking for the most favorable
# superpositions of ligand functional groups with side chain spheres.
# Default is TS.
# SEARCH BB

# Pre-align method.
# If specified, this will do a preliminary dock of the ligand with only the specified
# residues, before going onto the normal whole-protein dock.
# This overrides the SEARCH parameter because pre-align search is mutually exclusive
# to both best-binding and tumble spheres searches.
# PREALIGN 109 203 251 255

# Minimum total binding energy in kJ/mol for output poses.
# Normally this should be either a cutoff threshold for pose screening or a
# small negative number to find all valid poses. Setting this to a positive value
# may cause impossible poses to be output, e.g. ones where atoms are clashing.
ELIM -0.01

# Uncomment this to enable kcal/mol output instead of the default kJ/mol.
# KCAL

# Side chain flexion: active if nonzero. Default: 1.
FLEX 1

# By default, only a few residues will be selected for flexion each pose, in order
# to agree with experimental data that most real world interactions involve three
# or fewer residue flexions:
# https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1097-0134(20000515)39:3%3C261::aid-prot90%3E3.0.co;2-4)
# But if a specific residue must flex in order to complete the dock, or must not flex
# in order to exclude non-agonists from the binding pocket, this can be set with
# FLXR and/or STCR parameters, respectively.
# Both residue numbers and Ballesteros-Weinstein numbers are accepted.
# FLXR 104 262 6.48                 # Force allow flexion.
# STCR 155 158 4.57 4.60            # Force prevent flexion.

# Optional: if this parameter is uncommented, a differential dock will occur, i.e.
# the total energy of the system will be computed before and after docking the ligand
# and each output value will be given as difference = with ligand minus without ligand.
# Note this increases calculation time as the protein is optimized before docking.
# DIFF

# Optional: If this parameter is uncommented, PrimaryDock will generate up to the
# specified number of water molecules in the binding pocket.
# H2O 10

# Optional: If uncommented, this parameter will activate hydrophobic cohesion, which
# keeps nonpolar groups close together in simulation of an aqueous environment,
# without computing individual water molecules.
# WET

# Number of iterations per path node per pose.
# Higher values equal more precision but decreasing gains and longer processing
# times. Multiples of 10 work best. Default: 50.
ITERS 50

# Optional output file for docking results. Use a file path with filename,
# no spaces. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.
# For best results, include the receptor id (e.g. OR1A1, TAAR5) in the output filename,
# or use the placeholder %p which will auto-replace with the receptor id.
# The %l placeholder stands in for the ligand name auto-replacement.
OUT output/%p_%l.dock

# Optional: If docking in a custom PDB that is not one of the included olfactory PDBs,
# the docked PDB can be appended to the .dock file so that the viewer can display the
# entire result including the protein backbone:
# APPENDPROT
